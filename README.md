# CSC355Project
A Magic: The Gathering database and collection system

### How to Run
1. Make sure you're on UNCW Wi-Fi (or using Cisco VPN)
2. Follow steps in CSC 355 Lab #17 to download FileZilla & connect to UNCW servers
3. Transfer relevant project files from your system to the `public_html` folder on the UNCW server
4. Connect to your UNCW URL to test it (also in Lab #17)
5. Files must be re-uploaded to the server every time a change is made (sowwy)
